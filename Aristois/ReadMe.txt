Aristois is an open source encryptor for lua 5.1 it is recommended to add -
to this project and change things up heavily as iron brew of course is bad.
Concat dumping has been patched on this project and the decrypt function -
has been hidden in the vm section. 

Todo for serious use:
Hide key,
Protect the encrypted content via obfuscation maybe even use lua obfs api idk,
Compress bytecode
Maybe obfuscate code before it gets into in.lua

This was made simple and fast and i dont want to be laughed at for any cracks -
or flaws that werent fixed i wouldnt release a good project open source :)

Will eventually make a v2 and either release it OS or have it as a discord bot.
